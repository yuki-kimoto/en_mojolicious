<h2> morbo --Mojolicious development server </ h2>



<b> morbo </ b> is the development server that comes with Mojolicious by default. Web development is very convenient because it automatically detects file changes and restarts the server automatically.

<h4> morbo doesn't work on Windows </ h4>

morbo does not detect the file and restart successfully on Windows. (As of April 27, 2018)

This makes developing on Windows very stressful.

I created a batch file called winmorbo to solve this problem, so please use it.

<h4> Specify the port number </ h4>

When you start the test server on morbo, the application usually starts on port number 3000.

This can be changed with the <b> --listen </ b> option.

<pre>
morbo --listen = http: //*:3001 myapp.pl
</ pre>

It can also be specified by setting the <b> MOJO_LISTEN </ b> environment variable.

<pre>
export MOJO_LISTEN = http: // *: 3001
morbo a.pl
