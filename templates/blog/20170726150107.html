This benchmark seems to show "Responses per second at 20 queries per request". It's like a benchmark that looks at performance against multiple queries. <a href="https://irclog.perlgeek.de/mojo/"> Mojolicious's irc</a> was posted, so I will introduce it.

It's a bit small and hard to see, but Mojoliciosu seems to be able to return 5,353 responses per second. 56.6%faster than the fastest C ++ framework. It's 1.76 times faster than C ++.

In this benchmark, a single query isn't that fast, but multiple queries seem to be pretty fast. I'm not very familiar with web performance, so I can't say for sure, but I think the benchmark for multiple queries is closer to reality.

Perl is said to be 20 to 100 times slower than C / C ++, but the benchmark for multiple queries on the Web is 1.76 times slower than C ++.

<h3> Why is it 1.76 times larger than C ++? </H3>

I'm not very familiar with it, so I'll guess. The Web is an HTTP request and string processing, and Perl is strong in processing a large amount of strings. Memory usage can be kept small even for parallel access. Response performance is high because Full GC does not occur.

Numerical calculation is 20 to 100 times slower than C language, but when it comes to processing a large amount of text, it feels like performance is approaching C language.

Even in the field of the Web where Perl is actually used, there are cases where the performance of Perl is tolerated by the distribution of news and advertisements. Benchmarks may also represent this reality.

Mojolicious's asynchronous I / O design also contributes, but Perl's own performance may also contribute.

I know a little theory about performance, but I'm not sure about real-life Web performance because I haven't worked in such a field, so I wrote above as a guess.
