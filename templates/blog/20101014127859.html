<h2> Check the list of routes with Mojolicious :: Lite </ h2>



As the definition of <strong> route </ strong> increases, it becomes difficult to see what kind of route exists. You can use the "routes" command to see what routes exist at such times.

<pre>
perl myapp.pl routes
</ pre>

Then you can see the list of routes as follows.
<pre>
/ (?-xism: ^ (?: /)?)
/ hello /: date (?-xism: ^ / hello / ([^ \ / \.] +))
</ pre>
