<h2> Hello World! Application with Mojolicious </ h2>



The Hello World application (hello.pl) by Mojolicious writes: We will use a module called Mojolicious :: Lite included in Mojolicious. It's just three lines, but it's a complete web application.

<pre>
use Mojolicious :: Lite;
get'/' => sub {shift-> render (text =>'Hello World!')};
app-> start;
</ pre>

Let's run the application on an embedded web server. Run the <a href="/blog/20120406133367.html"> morbo </a> command on the command line.

<pre>
morbo hello.pl
</ pre>

The web application is launched with the port number 3000.

<pre>
Server available at http://127.0.0.1:3000.
</ pre>

Access the following URL on your browser.

<pre>
